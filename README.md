# Hello-World
I will go back to graduate school in August majoring in construction engineering and management at Virginia Tech, USA.
It is great news for me to work with a young and excellent professor and to join in the interesting projects.
To prepare for my research there, I am practicing the exercieses from the book <Learn Python, the hard way>.
Actually in my undergraduate period, I have learnt about python for my graduation thesis.
However, I find it is more difficult to code with python than understanding codes by others.

I hope after this summer, I could get familiar with Python and make use of it to help with my research.
Wish everyone all the best :)
